## Your Questions Answered

*Everything you need to know about your 3-in-1 razor. Still have questions? Our support team is here to help 24/7.*

### Q: Is this safe for sensitive skin?
**A:** Yes! The 3-in-1 razor features hypoallergenic blades and smooth glide technology designed specifically to minimize irritation. Many of our customers with sensitive skin report less razor burn and discomfort compared to traditional razors. If you have concerns, we recommend starting on the trimmer setting and adjusting as your skin adapts.

### Q: How do I clean and maintain the razor?
**A:** Cleaning is easy! After each use, rinse the blade heads under running water for a few seconds—that's it. For deeper cleaning once a week, remove the heads and use the included brush to remove any trapped hair. The razor is water-resistant but should not be fully submerged. Let it air dry before storing.

### Q: How long does the battery last?
**A:** A full charge provides up to 60 minutes of continuous use—enough for 3-4 weeks of daily grooming for most men. Charging takes approximately 2 hours using the included USB cable. The LED indicator shows when charging is complete. You can also use it while plugged in if you forget to charge.

### Q: Can I use this for wet shaving or just dry?
**A:** The razor is designed primarily for dry use, which is what makes it so quick and convenient. However, it's water-resistant, so you can safely rinse your face before use. For best results and blade longevity, we recommend dry shaving or using it on slightly damp (not wet) skin.

### Q: What's included in the box?
**A:** Your package includes: the main razor unit, 3 interchangeable heads (shaver, trimmer, detail groomer), USB charging cable, cleaning brush, protective travel cap, and a user manual with grooming tips. Everything you need to get started arrives ready to use.

### Q: How long does shipping take?
**A:** We process orders within 1-2 business days. Standard shipping takes 3-5 business days, and express shipping takes 1-2 business days. You'll receive a tracking number as soon as your order ships. Free shipping is included on all orders over $50.

### Q: What if I'm not satisfied with my purchase?
**A:** We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied, return the razor in its original condition within 30 days for a full refund—no questions asked. We want you to love your grooming routine, and we stand behind our product 100%.
